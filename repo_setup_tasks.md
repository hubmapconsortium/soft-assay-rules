# Steps To Get This Repo Started

- [x] **TODO**: Fill in the README sections below the `<hr>` at the bottom of this page.
- Github settings:
  - [ ] **TODO**: Under "General", turn off github features you don't need, and turn on others that aren't the default. Suggestions:
    - "Wikis" off.
    - "Projects" off.
    - "Allow merge commits" and "Allow rebase merging" off; "Allow squash merging" on.
    - "Automatically delete head branches" on.
  - [x] **TODO**: Under "Collaborators and teams" add users besides yourself.
  - [x] **TODO**: Decide on a branch and PR strategy.
    - Feature branches from `main` work for many repos, but if a different strategy (like [gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow)) would work better, explain the strategy in the README, and update the default branch.
    - Add branch protection rules. Suggested rules:
      - "Require a pull request before merging"
      - "Require status checks to pass before merging"
  - [x] **TODO**: Under "Code security and analysis", turn on:
    - Dependabot
    - Code scanning
- Github issues:
  - [ ] **TODO**: Decide how you want issues reported, and document that decision in the README. Suggest that you create a `triage` label, and use the provided issue template that applies it automatically. Asking that users go through the helpdesk or slack is also reasonable, as is a commitment to keep an eye open for any incoming issues.
  - [ ] **TODO**: Establish responsibility for incoming issues. Suggest that one person saves the url for a filtered list of `triage` issues, reviews the list every day, and removes the `triage` label once they have been reviewed.
  - [ ] **TODO**: Review the issue templates in this repo and edit to fit your needs.
  - [ ] **TODO**: Remove issue labels that do not add much value. Suggest removing `duplicate`, `good first issue`, `help wanted`, `invalid`, `question`.
  - [ ] **TODO**: Add issue labels as needed. Suggest adding `triage`.
- Github CI:
  - [ ] **TODO**: Under `.github/workflows`, update the provided examples as appropriate for your toolchain. Suggest starting with linting and tests. Suggest having each check as a separate workflow, so if there is a failure, its easy to tell at a glance what it was.
